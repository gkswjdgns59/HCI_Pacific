# Team Pacific : Aster

> Party managing system for off-campus homeloners

> POV: Aster met off campus home loner who holds the home party. Aster is amazed to realize that he/she quite often feels burdened to talk about subtle upset, regarding home party. So, itâ€™d be game-changing for Aster to convey messages (home party manner), preventing conflicts in human relationship.
